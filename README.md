# Project_Tetris
project_Chinese_Character_Version_of_Tetris for CSC3002 for more detail see report.doc

The program consists of three main parts: graph user interface (GUI), character board and networking. The graph user interface interacts with the player directly. It allows the user to select different modes and play game through push buttons. It also displays the current score and level of the ongoing game. Character board implements the gameâ€™s main logic. It receives the signals emitted from GUI or keyboard to control the game flow. Networking allows users with different IPs to play the game simultaneously (provides LAN for two players with windows operating system).
